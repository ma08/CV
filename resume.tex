% \section{Statement of Purpose}
% Being a fast learner and versatile are vital to participate in Opensoft. I find these qualities in me.I am a passionate programmer and I love solving puzzles and problems. I have good development  experience in C++ , Python , Java and Javascript.  I developed the complete website for Meaghnad Saha Hall. I was part of the Open Soft team of Meghnad Saha Hall of Residence for the Inter Hall Open Soft Competition 2014 and we  secured \textbf{BRONZE} in the event. Right now I am the Vice-Captain of Open Soft team of Meghnad Saha Hall of Residence. 



% Opensoft is a competition where you not only solve the given problem but you should also be able to  develop a software that is visually attractive. Design and UI matters a lot in developing a software. I am good with both backend and frontend development. I worked as a FULLSTACK DEVELOPER in a startup for my Second Year Internship. I along with 2 others were asked to develop a complete Social Networking Site which mainly comprises of Newsfeed,Chat,MailBox using Meanstack.I was responsible for developing the Newsfeed Service similar to facebook and LinkedIN. Inspite of not being familiar with the prescribed tools, I got myself acquainted with Angular, Node.js  in a short span of time and completed the whole Social Networking Site in 45days.

% The above qualities helped me in achieving an \textbf{Internship at Microsoft IDC, Hyderabad for 2015 Summer} and prove that I can be a valuable member to the Opensoft team
